HashTable:
    HashTable is previous version of HashMap. Hashtable is thread safe. it uses synchronization to achieve
    thread safety and because of this it is slow as compared to hashMap.
why we should not use Hashtable.
    As a Tester its very rare that we will be writing multithreaded code and if you don't write multithreaded
    code but still use HashTable it will make our code slow for no benefit.
Difference between HashMap and HashTable:
    Hashtable is thread safe while hashMap is not.
Maps:
    How can we iterate through a map
