Collections Framework:
    It's a collection of classes and interfaces that help us store and manipulate the data efficiently.
Why we should use Collections Framework?
    1) It's flexible( we don't need to provide size beforehand).
    2) It's dynamic(all the classes can increase and decrease their size at run time).
    3) There are built-in methods to perform common tasks.
    4) pre-built data structures.
downsides of Collections framework:
    1)we can't use primitive data types we have to use wrapper classes which occupy 4 times more memory
    than a primitive.
    int num=10 // 4 memory locations
    Integer num1=10; //16 memory locations
Wrapper:
    Wrapper classes are object types for all the primitive types
why should we learn about the wrapper types?
    1) Because collections framework only supports wrapper types.
    2)
